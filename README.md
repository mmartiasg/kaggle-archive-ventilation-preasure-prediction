# kaggle-archive-ventilation-preasure-prediction

This is the work I did for a pass competition in 2021

The objective is to simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patien's lung. it seems simple but spoiler alert it's not that easy. There is only 3 seconds per breath you have to work with. I've tried several thecniques with relative susscess but a lot to lear from that.
